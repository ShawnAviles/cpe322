# CPE 322 - Lab 7

Lab provides students with experience using ThingSpeak and Google Sheets APIs

## Run thingspeak_cpu_loop.py



## Install gspread and oauth2client



## Log in the Google Cloud Platform Identity and Access Management, create a project cpudata, enable both Drive API and Sheets API
I am using one centralized project called `senior-design-6` to hold my lab keys so that is why my key name is prepended diffrenty.


## Google sheet cpudata with edited header cells



## Run cpu_spreadsheet.py with the JSON key file
